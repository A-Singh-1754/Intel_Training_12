Hello this is the Repo I have made to submit my Project on the 12th Problem Statement of Intel Unnati Industrial Training titled "Knowledge Representation and Insights Generation from Structured Datasets". All of the project was done by only one person.
Although I wish I could have done a better job at it, I am a bit happy to even be submitting a working project.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify individuals' income levels and generate insights from the dataset. The workflow includes:

1. Data Ingestion
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training and Evaluation
6. Outlier Detection
7. Report Generation

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **numpy**: Numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **seaborn**: Advanced statistical graphics
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment (optional)
- **Diagrams.net**: Architecture diagram creation (optional)

Just cloning the repo and extracting it should be enough to make it work. Report will be generated once all the cells inside the Notebook are executed although I have already uploaded the ones that I generated so that you can see what they look like even without running the project. 
The file paths I have used are all absolute so be sure to change them to relative or atleast to absolutes for your system.
